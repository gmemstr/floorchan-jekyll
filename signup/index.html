<p>Interested in signing up?</p>
<p>First, understand that what you're getting is not the most amazing service out there. While we try our hardest to keep stuff online as much as possible, it doesn't always work out.</p>
<p>Next, take a look at our <a href="/rules/" target="_blank">rules</a> and make sure you're familiar with them.</p>
<p>Accounts are created manually; you will recieve a email notification once your account is available to use.</p>
<p>Finally, please realize that a lot of the admins on here are not very accepting of potentially controversial content or usernames, so if you plan to use your account to further your own political beliefs, please look elsewhere, because we don't want to deal with the problems that arise from that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we've got a Google Docs form embedded below, or if you'd like to go to the form in a new window/tab, click <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGl1THNSOE1sSHVjQ2Q2bFF5Y29ITUE6MQ" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
